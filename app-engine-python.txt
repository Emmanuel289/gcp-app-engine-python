 #Create a simple request handler

 #using your favorite editor, create a helloworld.py script that acts as a simple request handler. The Pyhton script responds to a request with an
 #HTTP header that describes the content and the message Hello, World!

 #Next, create a configuration file called app.yaml. The config file will describe which handler scripts should be used
 #for which urls. It will also specify the python runtime and version, the ability to handle simultaneous requests and
 #requests whose path matches the regular expression /.* (all URLs) should be handled by the app object in the helloworld
 #module.
 $dev_appserver.py ./  #deploy a local instance of the app server to see that it works as expected
 $gcloud app deploy app.yaml  #deploy the helloworld server to the production App Engine environment.
